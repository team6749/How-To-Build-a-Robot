- [ ] explaining the game
    
    - [ ] explain considerations to building a robot. constraints and tradeoffs. use a simple 2 attribute robot (speed, size). explain the trade-offs
        
        - [ ] explain importance of reliability and consistency
        - [ ] show a couple of previous year games
        - [ ] keep it interactive (have people suggest designs and after explaining the rough rules)
        - [ ] explain relationship to robot design strategy and game strategy (do not go into detail this is part of scouting)
        
    
- [ ] basic software
    
    - [ ] explain programming; java (maybe an intro video)
        
        - [ ] simple robot programming concepts (does not need to be understood, just an intro. programming docs is for training)
        - [ ] spend time going into a random topic (like html web pages or java vs javascript or something)
        - [ ] explain github and explain our workflow
        
    
- [ ] safety
- [ ] collaboration tools
    
    - [ ] trello
        
        - [ ] github
        
    
- [ ] tools (teach each tool)
- [ ] mechanical (explain different mechanical stuff like joints, and bearings, etc...)
- [ ] electrical parts (and what they do)
- [ ] wiring (how to wire)
- [ ] pneumatics
- [ ] cad
- [ ] scouting (explain the importance of data for strategy, go into explaining more complex game strategy).
- [ ] business units (give time to business units to explain their importance)
- [ ] building introduction. have people build simple contraptions and teach some ways to build things. encourage prototyping and only using tools where necessary. avoid building whole robots, solve simple challenges. use a drill with hex adapter as a power source.
- [ ] zero to robot and coding docs
- [ ] wpilib docs page for software and hardware (everyone should read over it every year, as best practices change regularly)
