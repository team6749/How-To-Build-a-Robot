this is the process of analyising an frc game and building a robot to optimize for points. This process is intended to be flexible, and iterated on. this means that each time it is done it will change. 

The most important part of the FRC game each year is understanding the game at a high level; so that you know HOW to complete the game, not SPECIFICALLY HOW to complete the game. This is important because it can lead to important information getting lost if we do not understand how the game is played. It is important to write down everything for reference later. 

Before you do anything read the entire manual front to back; maybe a specific detail will be insightful in the overall analysis!

Note: This vault uses FRC 2023 - Charged Up as an example game for analysis.
