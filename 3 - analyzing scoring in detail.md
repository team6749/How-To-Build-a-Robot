now that we have an idea of where points come from and how relatively difficult scoring might be as well as constraints for where we can pick up points, or how realistic certain scoring scenarios are, lets start calculating some numbers to estimate the most effective way to generate points in each game!

## Cycling
since this years game has a well-defined **acquire, place, repeat** flow (as do most FRC games); we want to calculate something called the cycle time, basically how many times we can cycle game pieces into a scored position. `Each cycle consists of a game piece being picked up/retrieved, and then driven across the field to be scored, and then driving back to the retrieval area.`
## Scoring: giving it some numbers
Lets start immediately after a piece has been scored. We need to drive the robot across the field. This will take about 5 seconds in a straight line, lets add a second to that because of the akward path around our Charge Station. Lets say 6 seconds to travel to the charging station. Then to acquire the game piece. Ideally a piece off of the double substation would take a few seconds, 3. And a piece from the floor will take slightly longer, 5 seconds. Driving back takes another 6 seconds, and placing the game piece should take about 5 seconds. This means our cycle time would be about 6+3+6+5=20 seconds. Over the period of teleop minus 20 seconds to dock this means we could score 5 times. Each scored game piece is worth points, and each link is worth bonus points. **Scoring on the top row is worth the most points, middle second, and bottom the least with 5, 3, and 2 points respectively**. Each link is worth 5 points. Ideally we score 6 pieces on the top row with 2 links, that would be worth 5 * 5 + 5 * 2 = 35 points. Scoring all in the bottom would result in 2 * 5 + 5 * 2 = 20 points. We can also score 1 point in auto which is worth an extra point, 6 for scoring high. meaning we could score 23-41 points. Over auto + teleop - docking time. See below for scoring criteria.
## Scoring Criteria (taken from 2023 manual)

## Charge Station
The charge station gives 12 points for a robot that is [[docked]] and [[engaged]] in auto (only 1 robot max), and at the end of the match, 10 points for each robot [[docked]] an [[engaged]]. If we can dock in auto and also dock at the end of the match, we could earn the alliance 12 + 10 = 22 points. If we can support another alliance to climb up that would be another 10 points, so 32 points. We will notice that the time it takes to dock is significantly less than the time it is to score points for how much value it has. We will make note of this when designing our robot.

## Additional Scoring Notes
There are also bonuses for ranking points, for scoring links, and for charge station points. 26 charge station points only requires 1 robot in auto and 2 robots in telop to count, and 5 links scored also seems obtainable since we can theoretically score 2 links for each robot on the team, meaning 6 links total. However that requires 3 scoring robots, which might be less obtainable than docked robots. (Not meant to imply it is not doable, however it requires 3 smaller frame sizes.)

Lets finally consider since this game has a maximum score; what that is. I used this site to calculate it here (I assume that all points are scored, and 7 high pieces are scored in auto): https://coda.io/@benjamin-wilson/frc-2023-score-calculator
It ends up being 193 points. Cubes, cones, and links contribute up to 142 points and everything else contributes up to 51 points.
